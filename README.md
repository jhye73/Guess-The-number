The "Guess the Number" game is a Python-based project where the computer randomly selects a number within a specified range, and the player tries to guess it. With each guess, the game provides feedback indicating whether the guessed number is too high, too low, or correct. The game continues until the player correctly guesses the number. It incorporates loops, conditionals, and random number generation, making it a fantastic way to practice fundamental programming concepts.
